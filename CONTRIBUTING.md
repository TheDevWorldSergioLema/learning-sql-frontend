# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Brick by Brick SQL! Contributions are welcome: bug fixes, new steps, better explanations,
translations, accessibility and design improvements.

## Attribution

You're free to reuse ideas or code from this project. If you do, a link back to the project or to
[sergiolema.dev](https://sergiolema.dev) is appreciated. Contributors are credited through the Git history of
their pull requests.

## Before you start

- **Small fixes** (typos, wrong translation, small bug): open a pull request directly.
- **Larger changes** (a new step, a new feature, a redesign): open an issue first to describe what you want to do,
  so we can agree on it before you spend time on the code.
- **Bugs**: open an issue with the step, the browser, the language selected, the code you typed and what you
  expected to happen. A screenshot helps.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`, named `<type>/<scope>/<description>`, for example
   `feat/levels/join-steps` or `fix/i18n/german-hints`. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`.
2. Make your change, with tests.
3. Check everything passes:

   ```sh
   npm install
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run build
   ```

4. Open a pull request to `main`. Describe what changed and why, link the issue if there is one, and add a
   screenshot for any visual change.

I'll review it as soon as possible. I may ask for changes before merging; that's a normal part of the process.

## Guidelines

The full conventions are in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) and the architecture in [`README.md`](README.md). The main ones:

- **No hard-coded text.** Every user-facing text (labels, `title`, `aria-label`, `alt`, messages) goes through i18n,
  in all five locales: `src/i18n/locales/<en|fr|es|it|de>/translation.json`. If you don't speak a language, add the
  English text there and say so in the pull request: someone will translate it.
- **Design tokens only.** Colors, spacing, radii and fonts come from `src/styles/_config.scss` and
  `src/styles/_typography.scss`. Add a token when you need a new value.
- **One `.scss` file per component**, next to it, starting with `@use 'config' as *;`.
- **Icons** are React components in `src/components/icons`, using `currentColor`.
- **Plain JavaScript**: entities are JSDoc typedefs in `src/types/entities.js`, enums are frozen objects in
  `src/types`.
- **Tests** are grouped in at least two levels: the component or module name, then the test or group of tests.
- **Few comments**: the code should explain itself; comment only what isn't obvious.
- **Accessibility**: keyboard navigation and visible focus must keep working, and texts must keep a WCAG AA contrast.
- **Keep pull requests focused**: one subject per pull request, no unrelated reformatting.

## Adding or changing a step

- The code of a step lives in `src/views/playground/levels.js`; its texts in the translations under
  `levels.<id>` (`title`, `intro`, `goal`, `hints`, `recap`).
- The shop data (`src/views/playground/shopDatabase.js`) is code: table names, colors and statuses stay in English.
- Comments in a step's code are `-- {{key}}` placeholders, translated under `codeComments.<key>`, on one line.
- Inline code in texts uses backticks and stays identical in every language.
- The design is shared with [Brick by Brick](https://github.com/TheDevWorldSergioLema/learning-html-frontend):
  keep both consistent.

## Code of conduct

Be kind and constructive. Criticize code, not people. This project is made for learners: questions are welcome.
